# Olympic Lifting Fitness Tracker App

# The idea
This project aim was primarily to get me used to connecting to AWS services to retrieve information from the DynamoDB service.

It is also a good stab at making a web application for phones in particular, as a stepping stone before trying React-Native.

## Technology used
- Modern UI (MUI) Library for styling
- Framer motion for animation
- Chart.js for chart display
- AWS DynamoDB for database
- Figma for mockup designs

## Current Features
- For a registered user (not authentication), view and add lifts to Snatch and CJ

## Bugs
- Date on adding information is buggy
- Only adjusted screen size for phone (viewing Desktop is ugly)

## New Features
- Add multiple lifts per session (and adding highest lift to graph)
- Ability to select variation of lift (complexes)
- State management with Redux
- Table of contents for all lifts

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
